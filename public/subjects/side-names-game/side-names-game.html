          <br>Hyp, Adj, and Opp are short for Hypotenuse, Adjacent, and Opposite.

          Side names are used everywhere triangles are used. This skill will be reused.
          The trigonometric functions use these side names to refer to the sides they measure. It doesn't take much effort to learn these.

        <p>
          In the real world, there will be no interview questions where you are asked to identify a particular side of a triangle.
          Knowing how side names work relative to an angle being measured allows us to visualize and communicate ideas related to triangles.
          For instance, an exam might ask you to find the distance between a car and an airplane, and give you a point directly below the airplane.
          Those three points make a triangle between the car, the airplane, and the point on the ground.
          We put in the values for each board instead of measuring each one individually. It saved many work hours.
