LearnTrig.com
LearnTrig.com is not just a website; it's a journey into the essence of trigonometry, designed to unravel the complexities of spatial dimensions and their relation to polar and Cartesian coordinates. Developed by Joseph Sailor Usher, this platform is built on a foundation of simplicity, aiming to progressively guide learners from basic to advanced concepts in a coherent and intuitive manner.

Design Theory and Methodology
Spatial Dimensions
At the heart of LearnTrig.com's pedagogy lies the principle of starting from the simplest perspective. We delve into the one-dimensional space represented by a number line, extending this concept into two dimensions, where we explore the interplay between polar coordinates and Cartesian coordinates. This approach helps in building a fundamental understanding of space and how we represent points and intervals within it.

Triangles and Angles
Triangles, with their sides and angles, serve as the cornerstone of trigonometry. LearnTrig.com employs a unique naming system for triangle sides relative to a chosen angle, addressing the challenges and limitations of traditional methods. This system forms the basis for understanding trigonometric functions and their applications.

Interactive Learning through Games
Arc Lengths: A game that challenges players to estimate the length of a random arc on a circle, fostering an intuitive grasp of arc measurement.
Name that Side: Enhances understanding of triangle sides in relation to selected angles through interactive engagement.
Skill Progression Tree
A meticulously designed skill progression tree ensures a deep, connected understanding of trigonometry. Starting from recognizing side names to defining trig functions and understanding the intuition behind sine and cosine, each step is crafted to build upon the previous, culminating in the mastery of the unit circle and the recognition of radians and degrees.

Development Philosophy
LearnTrig.com is developed with the belief that mastering trigonometry is not just about learning formulas but understanding the fundamental principles of angles, rotation, and spatial dimensions. This understanding is crucial across various fields, including game design, architecture, and engineering, among others. The website employs a gamification approach, presenting concepts in an engaging and accessible manner, encouraging learners to explore trigonometry in a new light.
