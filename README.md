# LearnTrig.com - Understanding the Fabric of Space Through Trigonometry

## About

LearnTrig.com is a journey into the essence of trigonometry, simplifying the complexities of spatial dimensions and their relation to polar and Cartesian coordinates.

## Design Theory and Methodology

### Spatial Dimensions

Starting from the simplest perspective to build a fundamental understanding of space and how we represent points and intervals within it.

### Triangles and Angles

Addressing the challenges and limitations of traditional methods in understanding triangles and their angles.

### Interactive Learning through Games

Interactive games like **Arc Lengths** and **Name that Side** engage users in the learning process.
